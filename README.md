Electrical resistivity tomography is an efficient geophysical technique to investigate the spatial extent of subsurface structures. Many scientific objectives in geology demand three-dimensional imaging. 

3D electrical resistivity tomography provides a technique to survey three-dimensional structures. Nonetheless, 3D electrical resistivity tomography requires an enormous amount of time as well as high work load. 

In most cases 2D electrical resistivity tomography is used to obtain two-dimensional subsurface profiles. This package enables to visualize two-dimensional profiles in three dimensions.
