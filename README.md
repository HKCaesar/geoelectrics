R package to plot geoelectric resistivity measurement profiles
==============

Electrical resistivity tomography is an efficient geophysical technique to investigate the spatial extent of subsurface structures. Many scientific objectives in geology demand three-dimensional imaging.  3D electrical resistivity tomography provides a technique for surveying three-dimensional structures. Due to enormous amount of time as well as high work load it has still not been established in practice. In most cases 2D electrical resistivity tomography is used to obtain two-dimensional subsurface profiles. This package investigates the possibility of visualizing two-dimensional profiles in three dimensions.
